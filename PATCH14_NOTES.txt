PATCH14 (v0.1.1): Lunar orography via LOLA DEM (LDEM_16) heightfield

What you get:
- Optional lunar DEM support for the Moon surface:
  - DEM-driven per-ray intersection refinement (iterative local sphere radius)
  - DEM-derived surface normals (finite-difference) for Lambert shading
  - Two new cube layers: ELEV_M (metres) and SLOPDEG (degrees)

Files changed/added:
- synthmoon/run_v0.py        (DEM load + refinement + new layers)
- synthmoon/intersect.py     (new ray_sphere_intersect_varradius)
- synthmoon/albedo_maps.py   (new EquirectMap.sample_bilinear)
- synthmoon/moon_dem.py      (new module)

How to enable in scene.toml:

[moon]
dem_fits = "DATA/moon_dem_lola_ldem16_m.fits"
dem_lon_mode = "0_360"
dem_units = "m"
dem_scale = 1.0
dem_refine_iter = 3

(Keep your LROC albedo map lines as before.)

Sanity checks:
- In DS9, browse cube layers and confirm ELEV_M and SLOPDEG are non-zero on the lunar disk.
- If relief looks subtle, set dem_scale=3.0 temporarily, rerun, then set back to 1.0.

Notes:
- This is NOT terrain self-shadowing yet; it changes intersection depth + surface normals (slope lighting).
- DEM values are treated as ABSOLUTE radius from Moon centre. Your LDEM_16 conversion produces that (offset ~1737400 m).
