We’re building a modular Python renderer for synthetic Moon images (512×512, 1°×1° FOV) with correct SPICE celestial geometry. Illumination includes sunlight + extended-source earthlight (earthshine). Moon surface uses a DEM for orography; Lambert initially, Hapke later; spectral rendering later (solar spectrum + wavelength-dependent BRDFs). Compute everything in float; output 16-bit FITS using BSCALE/BZERO; extensive FITS header including JD-OBS formatted as f15.7 (no MJD). User choices live in one scene.toml config. Performance: render Moon ROI only; cheap bounding-sphere hit mask; DEM refine; earthlight via Earth-disk quadrature with tile caching and horizon early-outs.
