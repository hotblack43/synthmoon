These are starter project text files for the synthetic Moon renderer.

Files:
- SPEC.md              Project specification and design decisions
- scene.toml           Central configuration template
- context_capsule.txt  Short summary you can paste into a new chat to restore context

If you want to recreate these files locally without manual copy/paste,
run the included script:

    python write_project_files.py

It will write SPEC.md, scene.toml, and context_capsule.txt into the current directory.
