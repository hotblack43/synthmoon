PATCH20: Moon-fixed frame selection that actually works (MOON_ME / MOON_PA)

Fixes
- Adds resolve_moon_frame() and uses it AFTER kernels are loaded.
- If you request MOON_ME or MOON_PA but the generic alias isn't present, it falls back to the DE440-specific names:
    MOON_ME_DE440_ME421
    MOON_PA_DE440
- Writes both MFRAMREQ (requested) and MFRAME (resolved) in the FITS header.

Meta-kernel reminder
To use the DE440 high-accuracy frames you must load (in addition to naif0012.tls, pck00011.tpc, de442s.bsp):
  $KERNELS/pck/moon_pa_de440_200625.bpc
  $KERNELS/fk/satellites/moon_de440_250416.tf
Optionally (gives the *generic* aliases MOON_ME and MOON_PA):
  $KERNELS/fk/satellites/moon_assoc_me.tf
  $KERNELS/fk/satellites/moon_assoc_pa.tf

scene.toml
  [moon]
  spice_frame = "MOON_ME"   # or "MOON_PA"; or set explicit DE440 name
