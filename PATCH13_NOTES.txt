PATCH13: Lunar orography (LOLA LDEM) support (v0.1.1)

What you get
------------
1) Optional lunar DEM (orography) that affects:
   - hit-point radius (small shift along ray)
   - surface normals (slope changes the Lambert term)
2) New output layers (in the cube):
   - DEM_M     : DEM height in metres (0 for off-disk)
   - SLOPDEG   : slope angle in degrees (0 for off-disk)

Important caveats (v0.1.x)
--------------------------
- This is NOT a full ray/mesh intersection with detailed terrain self-shadowing.
  It is a "heightfield on a sphere" with a few Newton-like refinements along each ray
  + normal derived from DEM gradients. This is the right *modular* stepping stone.
- DEM is assumed to be equirectangular (simple cylindrical) global coverage.

How to use
----------
1) Apply patch:
   unzip -o synthmoon_v0_patch13.zip -d .

2) Download/convert a LOLA DEM (choose ppd=16 for more detail; ppd=4 is tiny + quick):
   uv run python scripts/download_lola_ldem_dem.py --ppd 16

   This writes e.g.:
     DATA/moon_dem_lola_ldem16_m_int16.fits

3) Enable DEM in scene.toml:
   [moon]
   dem_fits = "DATA/moon_dem_lola_ldem16_m_int16.fits"
   dem_lon_mode = "0_360"        # LOLA cylindrical IMG products are 0..360E longitudes
   dem_units = "m"               # metres
   dem_scale = 1.0               # multiply DEM by this factor (handy for tests)

4) Run:
   PYTHONPATH=$PWD uv run python -m synthmoon.run_v0 --config scene.toml

Quick sanity test
-----------------
After rendering, you should see DEM_M and SLOPDEG layers in DS9's cube slider.
